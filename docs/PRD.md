# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for SubTrack

## Project Overview
SubTrack is a comprehensive subscription management platform that empowers users to take control of their recurring expenses. In today's subscription-based economy, consumers often lose track of their various subscriptions across streaming services, software tools, membership programs, and other recurring charges. SubTrack solves this problem by providing a centralized hub for managing all subscription services.

The platform features an intuitive dashboard that gives users immediate visibility into their subscription landscape. Users can track payment dates, monitor spending patterns, and organize subscriptions into custom collections and categories. The system goes beyond simple tracking by providing proactive notifications about upcoming charges and offering tools to help users make informed decisions about their subscriptions.

Key Differentiators:

- Privacy-First Approach: Unlike competitors, SubTrack prioritizes user privacy and doesn't require direct access to banking information
- Flexible Organization: Custom collections and categories allow users to organize subscriptions in ways that make sense for their specific needs
- Proactive Management: Integration with calendar and task management tools helps users take action before unwanted renewals
- Data Portability: Users maintain control of their data with easy export capabilities

The platform is designed to scale with users' needs, whether they're managing a handful of personal subscriptions or dozens of business-related services.
